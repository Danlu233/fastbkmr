Description: Implements a faster version of Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression using 
    supervised random Fourier features to approximate the Gaussian process. Provides functions 
    for estimating joint health effects of multiple exposures, as well as marginal, single-, 
    and two-exposure response functions. The methodology is described in Zhang et al. (2025).
